## Description  :bookmark_tabs:
The motivation behind creating NoteMaster was to address the need for a simple and efficient way to organize and manage notes. As a busy developer/individual, keeping track of ideas, tasks, and important information can be challenging. NoteMaster provides a convenient solution for capturing, storing, and accessing notes from any device with an internet connection. NoteMaster solves the problem of scattered notes and disorganized information by offering a centralized platform for note-taking. Users can easily create new notes and delete them if they do not need them anymore. 
Creating NoteMaster was a total challenge for the reason that I wasn't really sure how express works (or implement it) but there is no doubt that it was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to deepen my understanding of web development, particularly in the areas of front-end and back-end integration. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript, express.js and node.js plus a bit more understanding of Bootstrap. I also learned how to interact with a server-side API to store and retrieve data, improving my skills in asynchronous JavaScript and HTTP requests.
